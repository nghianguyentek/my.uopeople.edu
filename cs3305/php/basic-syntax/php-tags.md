# PHP tags

In PHP files, we must enclosed PHP code in PHP block that begin with the start tag `<?php` and the end tag `?>`. If the file contains all PHP code, we put the start tag at the beginning of the file and omit the end tag.

## Syntax

```php
<?php
// PHP code here
?>
```

or 

```php
<?= expression ?>  // equivalent to <?php echo expression; ?>
```
