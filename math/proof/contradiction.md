# Proof by Contradiction

## Steps

1. Presume that a statement is incorrect
1. Use logical deductions to show the presumption is incorrect
1. Conclude the original statement is correct

## Examples

### There is no largest integer

#### Solution

1. Assume there is a largest integer B
1. Let `C = B + 1`, Since C is the sum of two integers, it must be an integer and there is no way for C to be less than B
1. B is not the largest integer
1. Conclude there is no largest integer
