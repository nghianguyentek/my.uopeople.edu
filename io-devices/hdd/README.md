A platter has two sides filled with a thin magnetic layer.

#### Platter surfaces

A platter surface is one of its side.

#### Tracks

A track is a concentric circle in a [surface](#platter-surfaces).

### Spindle

### Disk head

A device is used to sense (read) and induce a charge (write) on a [surface](#platter-surfaces).

### Disk arm
