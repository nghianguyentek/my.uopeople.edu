# Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE is an application used to help developers in their work. In basic form, it's a [text editor](../text-editor/README.md) with code syntax highlighting, code auto-completion, code refactoring, and ways to configure the integrations with built tools and debuggers.
