# Linter

Linter is a source code scanner software to find bugs, known or potential security vulnerabilities, coding convention violence, and suspicious problems. It doesn't only identify issues but also provides recommended solutions. Thus, it helps developers write cleaner, better, and safer codes. Sometimes, it may raise false alarms; however, we can easily update the policies (rules) to fix or bypass them directly with explanations. Nowadays, they are often in an IDE extension form, and many companies force to pass linter checking before merging code.
