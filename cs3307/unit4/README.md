## Written Assignment

Choose two different file types(among ASCII, Binary, and EXE) and create a document that explains the basic concepts of editing programs such as Emacs or Vim in a way that is easy for a novice to understand. The document should use the chosen file types as examples to illustrate (using Emacs or Vim) the concepts being discussed.  

Include a screenshot of your Emacs or Vim running on your system. Support your document with explanations using adequate examples and screenshots wherever required.

You will be assessed on:
- Your screenshot of launching Emacs or Vim.
- Your explanation of basic concepts of editing programs such as Emacs or Vim, using two or more files as examples and providing relevant screenshots.

Submit a paper that is more than 1000 words in length exclusive of the reference page, double-spaced using 12-point Times New Roman font. The paper must cite a minimum of two sources in APA format and be well-written. Check all content for grammar, spelling and be sure that you have properly cited all resources (in APA format) used.

## Learning Journal

Navigating Emacs is an essential tool for many users using a Unix-based system, including Linux and Mac. Use the resource from the readings along with your own research and explore some basic editing commands in Emacs, and write a summary of any observations, challenges, and opinions you have about the program.

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 500 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.
