## Discussion Assignment

The purpose of this discussion is to examine the technical differences between the two popular operating systems of Windows and Mac, including their pros and cons. The goal is to understand the unique features and capabilities of each system and to consider whether there is a need for both of them depending on different situations.

Instructions:
- Begin by reading the relevant reading assignments and researching the technical differences between Windows and Mac operating systems. Consider factors such as hardware compatibility, system performance, security features, and user interface.
- Write a post that summarizes your findings and provides a comparison of the technical differences between the two operating systems.
- In your post, address the following questions:
  - What are the main technical differences between Windows and Mac operating systems?
  - What are the pros and cons of each system?
  - Is there a need for both Windows and Mac operating systems depending on different situations? Why or why not?

In your responses to your classmates' posts, expand on their points and provide additional insights or examples to support your points.

Your discussion post must be a minimum of 200 words.

## Written Assignment

As a senior developer at a software company, you have been asked to write a training document for junior developers on parallel computing. Your company is looking to introduce parallel computing techniques in various projects, and the junior developers need to understand the basics before they can start working on these projects.

Write a training document that explains the concept of parallel computing and how it works to a layperson. In your document, you should also explain the use of parallel computing in at least two different work environments and identify the operating system that you believe would be best suited for a workplace that relies heavily on parallel computing. Justify your answer.

You will be assessed on:
- Your explanation of parallel computing, including its fundamental principles, and how it works using appropriate examples to help the reader understand.
- Your discussion of at least two different work environments where parallel computing is used, and the detailed and accurate examples of how it is applied in each environment.
- Your identification and justification of the operating system that you believe would be best suited for a workplace that relies heavily on parallel computing.
- Organization and style of the essay (including APA formatting).

Submit a paper that is at least 2 pages in length exclusive of the reference page, double-spaced using 12-point Times New Roman font. The paper must cite a minimum of two sources in APA format and be well-written. Check all content for grammar, spelling and be sure that you have properly cited all resources (in APA format) used.

## Learning Journal

magine you are designing an operating system for a company. Read [Understanding the pros and cons of concurrency](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2021/10/19/understanding-the-pros-and-cons-of-concurrency/), and answer the following questions:
- Explain what your operating system would be used for and what components it would utilize, such as a GUI or command line interface, etc. 
- Would you give this OS a concurrency ability or not? 
- What would be the need to include/not include concurrency? 
- What would be the advantage (if any) of letting/not letting an OS run concurrently?

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 500 words and not more than 750 words. Use APA citations and references if you use ideas from the readings or other sources.
