## Discussion Assignment

As a developer, you may have encountered tasks related to navigating the file system, handling memory, and messaging between processes in an operating system. These can be complex concepts to understand, and it can be helpful to have a clear explanation and examples to refer to as you continue to develop your skills.

For this discussion, we would like to invite you to share your expertise and insights on these topics. Please feel free to provide explanations and examples to help others better understand how to navigate the file system, change the partitions and name drives, handle memory, and manage messaging between processes in an operating system. You may also include any relevant resources or materials that may be helpful for others to refer to as they learn more about these concepts.
In your responses to your classmates' posts, expand on their points and provide additional insights or examples to support your points. Use proper citation if you refer to any outside sources.

## Written Assignment

You have been tasked with creating technical documentation to assist your junior developers in understanding file systems, prompts, and remote procedure calls. The documentation should include screenshots and technical details in brief involving file systems, prompts, and remote procedure calls. In addition, you should find another resource on your own to explain security in a Unix/Linux operating system to help your fellow employee. You should use bullet points where needed to help organize the information and make it easier to understand.

To complete this assignment, you should review the document - [What is technical documentation](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/technical-documentation), to get a sense of how technical documentation is typically structured. Then, use the readings provided to you to provide a detailed explanation of what is happening within the operating system and explain the role and function of the file system, how it relates to memory, and how remote procedure calls are done.

As you work on this assignment, be sure to keep in mind that the goal is to provide your junior developers with a thorough understanding of the topic at hand.

You will be assessed on:
- Your explanation of file systems, prompts, and remote procedure calls, including their fundamental principles and functions, with well-explained examples and appropriate screenshots to illustrate the concepts.
- Your discussion of security in a Unix/Linux operating system.
- Organization and style of the essay (including APA formatting).

Submit a paper that is at least 3 pages in length exclusive of the reference page, double-spaced using 12-point Times New Roman font. The paper must cite a minimum of two sources in APA format and be well-written. Check all content for grammar and spelling, and be sure that you have properly cited all resources (in APA format) used.
