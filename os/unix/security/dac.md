# Discretionary Access Control (DAC)

DAC is a relatively simple security model letting the object owner control its permissions. In Unix-like OSes, a well-known DAC implementation is [file permission](file-permission.md).

## Advantages

- General simplicity
- Flexibility

## Disadvantages

- Sensitive information vulnerability (see [Mandatory Access Control (MAC)](mac.md))
