## Types

- Real-time OS (RTOS)
  - Depends on clock interruptions (Interrupt Service Routine - ISR)
  - Stored on ROM (Read-Only Memory) chip
- Multi-tasking OS
  - Preemptive OS: a multi-tasking OS with task priority function
- Rate Monotonic OS
  - Use Rate Monotonic Scheduling method, a priority-based scheduling algorithm
- Single System Control Loop
  - Simple
  - Perform only one function

## Advantages

- Small and fast-load
- Low cost
- Easy to manage
- Better stability
- Higher reliability
- Interconnections
- Low power consumption
- Incease product quality

## Disadvantages

- Not easy to maintain
- Harder troubleshooting
- Limitted resources: hardware, memory, etc.
- Not easy to take a back of
- Can't change, improve, or update
- Need to restart setting if any problem occurs
