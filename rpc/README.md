# Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

RPC is a protocol designed for calling procedures of processes running on other hosts.

## Marshalling and unmarshalling

Marshalling is a process transformation in-memory data into a specific format for persistence or transmission. It's similar to the serialization process. On the other hand, unmarshalling is the reverse of marshalling, and similar to the deserialization process.
